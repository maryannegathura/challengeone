Name of the project is challenge one which has three files : Net salary, Student grade generator and Speed detector.
In net salary, you just have to adjust the basicSalary and benefits values passed to calculateNetSalary() to calculate the net salary for different scenarios.
In student grade generator, You will calculate and display the grades for each student based on their marks as defined in the students array. 
This approach on student grade generator allows you to easily manage multiple students and their marks within the students array, making the grading process straightforward and scalable. 
Next we have speed detector Call checkSpeed(speed) with different speed values to see how the program responds.
In speed detector file, it will output either "Ok", "Points: <number>", or "License suspended" based on the speed input.
